Fixed addons (now appropriately linked to head)
gave kurin factions preset memes and precepts (battle foxes are feminist supremacist raiders and republic are individualist) 
removed apparel restriction
compatibility with moyo apparel
kurin factions now appropriately show on the select screen
Kurin now properly spawn with their custom names (this took me far too long i fucking swear)
Mod showcase scenario has basic kurin apparel research unlocked (was annoying not being able to dress your colonists)
Gave kurin a 50% chance of being Bisexual (solves the lack of romance in kurin exclusive colonies)
Merged Hot pants
made sure kurin spawn with the correct hairstyle (can't use tattoos either, but that can be reverted)
Fixed the hair color chances (not sure when, how or why, but a single color of brown hair had 100 weight and everything else had less than 10 effectively making them not spawn)
